# General Design Principles Found on the web

* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interfaces not implementations
* Loose coupling â€“ interacting components should have minimal knowledge about each other
* SOLID
  * Single responsibility
    * Class/method/function should do only one thing
  * Open/closed
    * Open for extension\, close for modification
  * Liskov substitution
    * Implementations of an interface should give same result
  * Interface segregation
    * Client should not have to use methods it does not need
  * Dependency inversion
    * High level modules should not depend on low level modules\, only on abstractions

# Some Research Software Specific Challenges

Many parts of the model and software system can be under research

Requirements change throughout the lifecycle as knowledge grows

Verification complicated by floating point representation

Real world is messy
